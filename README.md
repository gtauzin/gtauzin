## Hi, I'm Guillaume ðŸ‘‹

I'm a machine learning scientist and engineer with over 10 years of experience and a deep passion for ML package development. I enjoy breaking down complex problems into manageable components, crafting simple and interpretable solutions, and implementing them with clean, modular code. I'm a strong believer in open-source software and always eager to contribute to projects that align with these values.

### ðŸ§  About Me

- I work across a broad range of data science tasks and specialize in time series problems such as forecasting, anomaly detection, and classification.
- I lead data science projects built on [Kedro](https://github.com/kedro-org/kedro), using it to enhance structure, maintainability, and team collaboration. I highly recommend the Kedro communityâ€”I've learned so much from it and contribute back whenever I can.
- I'm enthusiastic about the philosophy and simplicity of the [scikit-learn](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn) API. I've worked on several packages that extend or integrate with it, though most remain closed source.
- In recent years, I've been especially interested in uncertainty quantification and conformal prediction.
- My academic and technical background spans engineering, applied mathematics, physics, and high-performance computing.

### ðŸ›  Selected Open-Source Projects

- **[kedro-dagster](https://github.com/gtauzin/kedro-dagster)**  
  A plugin for orchestrating Kedro pipelines using [Dagster](https://github.com/dagster-io/dagster), a modern, asset-oriented orchestrator.

- **[giotto-tda](https://github.com/giotto-ai/giotto-tda)**  
  Created during my postdoc at EPFL, this is an open-source Topological Data Analysis library for feature engineering and unsupervised learning, built on top of scikit-learn.

- **[metaLBM](https://github.com/gtauzin/metaLBM)**  
  Developed during my PhD, this is a GPU-accelerated C++ simulation package for turbulence modeling using MPI, OpenMP, and CUDA.
