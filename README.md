## Hi, I am Guillaume ðŸ‘‹

I am a ML scientist with 6y+ experience and a passion about ML frameworks development. I enjoy finding simple, interpretable solutions to problems and coding them in a modular way. I believe in FOSS and I look forward to making contributions.

To reach out to me, please use [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gtauzin/) or [mastodon](https://sigmoid.social/@gtauzin).

### About me
- I have been working on a number of tabular and time series tasks. At the moment, I make use of smart grid data to take on tasks such as anomaly detection, classification, and forecasting.
- I am enthusiastic about the philosophy and simplicity of the [scikit-learn](github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn) API. I have developped a number of packages extending and/or integrating with it.
- I have a diverse background spanning engineering, applied math, physics, and high-performance computing.

### Selected open-source projects
- During my PhD, I studied turbulence models and evaluated them numerically using [metaLBM](github.com/gtauzin/metaLBM), a C++ simulation package running on GPU clusters using MPI, OpenMP, and CUDA.
- During my postdoc at EPFL, I created [giotto-tda](github.com/giotto-ai/giotto-tda), an open-source Topological Data Analysis library for feature engineering and unsupervised learning extending scikit-learn.
